			<h2>The History of Barry B's</h2>
			<article>
				<img src="../images/barryb_rgb.png" alt="barryb">
				<p>Barry Beurmann was born in 1962. After deciding that school was not for him, he served our country in the United States air force.
				Barry is a great lover of food, wings being among his favorites. During his time in the service he began working on his ultimate creation: Barry B's Gourmet Hot Sauce.</p>
				<p>Through the years, Barry perfected his craft and developed the sauce that we all know and love today. He passed the recipe onto his only son, Jacob,
				who brought the delicious treat to market. He started small, opening stalls at farmers markets and craft shows in Northeast Ohio.</p>
				<p>Barry B's is now a Fortune 500 company, with distribution in over 9 different countries. Barry B's employs over 2500 dedicated employees. The company is dedicated to providing
				top of the line benefits and fair compensation. As CEO, Jacob  B collects a salary no greater than any other employee in the organization. Jacob believes that his employees are his family. </p>
